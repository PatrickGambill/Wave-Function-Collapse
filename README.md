# Wave-Function-Collapse
This is a simple implementation of the Wave Function Collapse Algorithm I created as instructional content. The main code is in the notebook. I included sample tiles and terrains I generated in the tiles and terrain files. The notebook also contains exercises suggesting further optimizations and other features to implement with the algorithm, should the students wish.
